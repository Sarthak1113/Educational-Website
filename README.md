It contains the programming language.Education is an aspect of socialization which involves the acquisition of knowledge and learning of skills. In an era known as the society of technology and knowledge, where lifelong learning is a way of life, it is important that educational institutions have as a priority the goal of finding effective ways of providing new learning opportunities according to their environment, student characteristics, teacher training, economic crisis and advancing technology in an effort to make learning more efficient, equitable and innovative in higher education. At Guarda Polytechnic Institute, Portugal (IPG), we recognize the need and the opportunities to create and develop new e-education courses (e-Learning, blended learning, mobile learning) in order to engage and motivate students according to their necessities. Thus, we have, in this last decade, developed and implemented a set of institutional objectives with regard to teaching electronic courses which aim to provide intuitive content courses online, easy to access anywhere in any place.
